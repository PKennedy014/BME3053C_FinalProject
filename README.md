  10. The Pneumonia Detection Model is also integrated into a simple to use MATLAB GUI App called PneumoniaApp.

Opening the Pneumonia App:
  1. First, download the zip folder containing all files within the repository and extract the zip to your working folder
  2. Open MATLAB and select the working folder
  3. To run the app, type "PneumoniaApp" into the MATLAB command window and the app should automatically open

Using the Pneumonia App:
  1. With the app open, click on the "Upload Image Folder" button and select the folder containing the images you would like to run through the Pneumonia Detection Model.
  2. Next, click the "Run Image Analysis" button to run the selected folder's images through the classification model
  3. When complete, the App will auto-fill the in-app table displaying image name, lung size (pixels), average pixel value, and finally the model prediction.
